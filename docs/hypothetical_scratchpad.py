''' API planning for a hypothetical auto-fixturing library.

Some thoughts:
+ What about defining the interfaces somewhere as an ABC-esque metaclass
  or something? That would let us define the public API somewhere
  standardized.
+ What about bidirectional interface spec? As in, for test generation,
  how do you make sure that the required external APIs from other
  components get called appropriately?
+ Can do the decorators without substantial performance hit by just
  adding fixture() function as an attribute to the method object. BUT,
  that requires a different method name!
  
Actually, can set anything as attr, and decorator can return the
original object. IE,

@interface
def func(self, *args, **kwargs):
    pass
    
func.__interface__ = True
func.fixture = decorator
func.__fixture__ = fixture
func.spec = decorator
func.__spec__ = spec

but both fixture and spec return the same func object, just with their
respective attributes filled in.

------

Furthermore, you don't want to define your ABC/interface in a separate
place. Yes, you may want to enforce interface consistency, but that's a
process control question, not a coding problem.

+ @interface can inject another __attr__ on top of abc.abstractmethod.
