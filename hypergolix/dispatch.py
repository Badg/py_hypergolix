class Dispatcher:
    ''' A standard, working dispatcher.
    
    Objects are dispatched to endpoints based on two criteria:
    
    1. API identifiers, or
    2. Application tokens.
    
    Application tokens should never be shared, as doing so may allow for
    local phishing. The token is meant to create a private and unique 
    identifier for that application; it is specific to that particular
    agent. Objects being dispatched by token will only be usable by that
    application at that agent.
    
    API identifiers (and objects dispatched by them), however, may be 
    shared as desired. They are not necessarily specific to a particular
    application; when sharing, the originating application has no 
    guarantees that the receiving application will be the same. They 
    serve only to enforce data interoperability.
    
    Ideally, the actual agent will eventually be capable of configuring
    which applications should have access to which APIs, but currently
    anything installed is considered trusted.
