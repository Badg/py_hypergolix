-----
0x0001: Does not appear to be a Golix object.
0x0002: Failed to verify.
0x0003: Unknown or invalid author or recipient.
0x0004: Unbound GEOC; immediately garbage collected
0x0005: Existing debinding for address; (de)binding rejected.
0x0006: Invalid or unknown target.
0x0007: Inconsistent author.
0x0008: Object does not exist at persistence provider.
0x0009: Attempt to upload illegal frame for dynamic binding. Indicates
        uploading a new dynamic binding without the root binding, or that
        the uploaded frame does not contain any existing frames in its
