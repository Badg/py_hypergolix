class AppObj:
    ''' A class for objects to be used by apps. Can be updated (if the 
    object was created by the connected Agent and is mutable) and have
    a state.
    
    AppObj instances will wrap their state in a dispatch structure 
    before updating golix containers.
    
    Can be initiated directly using a reference to an embed. May also be
    constructed from _EmbedBase.new_object.
    
    Everything here is wrapped from the messagepack dispatch format, so
    state may be more than just bytes.
    
    Unlike RawObj instances, AppObj instances are meant to be used with
    a specific API definition, and/or a specific token. Tokens can be 
    used to provide a consistent PRIVATE, freeform application state,
    whilst any objects that are being communicated to a different agent
    must use api ids.
    
    Basically, token-based AppObj instances without an api_id represent
    data that will not be shared. It can, however, be any unstructured
    data.
    
    _private isinstance bool
        if True, dispatch by token.
        if False, dispatch by api id.
        
    Note: AppObj should be set up such that there is exactly one AppObj
    per application. As such, they should probably be aware of their 
    endpoints.
    
    Note: Todo: Add some kind of automatic garbage collection mechanism
    such that, when gc'd because, for example, it is only defined within
    the scope of an AppObj state (as when linking between dynamic 
    objects), we don't continue to get updates for an object that we no
    longer retain.
