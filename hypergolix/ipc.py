Some thoughts:

All of IPC should use a single autoresponder. 
    + More likely than not, the same methodology should be applied to 
        persistence remotes, through the salmonator. Salmonator should
        then be moved into hypergolix.remotes instead of .persistence.
        
The IPCHost autoresponder isn't *quite* the same thing as Dispatch.
    + They're very tightly-coupled, yes, but look at the DoC: dispatch
        is concerned only with obj <--> endpoint, whereas IPC is focused
        on how, exactly, the endpoint communicates.
    + Endpoint registration should be moved into the IPC autoresponder.
        It should be called via dispatch's "distribute to endpoints" 
        method, which also needs to move. That will point the IPC host
        wholly in charge of tracking IPC, and Dispatch wholly in charge
        of object distribution.
        
All of the endpoint logic should be moved into IPCHost.
    + This definitely also applies to the app_token tracking. Use a 
        WeakValueDict to get the endpoint from the token. Then, when
        endpoint connections die (from closure, etc), they automatically
        are removed from available tokens.
    + This should also apply to api_ids, except it will need to be a
        WeakSetMap instead. Each api_id has a single key, and when an
        endpoint registers that api_id, it is added to the WSM. When the
        connection dies, so does the api_id mapping.
    + At least for now, applications must ephemerally declare themselves
        capable of supporting a given API. Note, once again, that these
        api_id registrations ONLY APPLY TO UNSOLICITED OBJECT SHARES!
        
Definitely add in more component awareness to IPCHost.
    + At the very least, add oracle and golcore. That way, dispatch can
        be bypassed for many requests.
    + Also convert it to use the now-standardized "assemble" API.
    
Should stop inferring object "private" status within dispatch.
    + There's really no reason to send app_token on the wire after the
        initial declaration
    + Reduced reliability, testing hassles, etc
    + This also means there's no good reason to store the app_token 
        within the _Dispatchable. Could simply and directly rely upon
        the Dispatcher's bootstrapped stateful privacy tracking object.
    + Use a private_by_ghid _GAODict() for <ghid>: <owning token> lookup
    
It'd be nice to remove the msgpack dependency in utils.IPCPackerMixIn.
    + Could use very simple serialization instead.
    + Very heavyweight for such a silly thing.
    + It would take very little time to remove.
    + This should wait until we have a different serialization for all
        of the core bootstrapping _GAOs. This, in turn, should wait 
        until after SmartyParse is converted to be async.
        
IPC Apps should not have access to objects that are not _Dispatchable.
    + Yes, this introduces some overhead. Currently, it isn't the most
        efficient abstraction.
    + Non-dispatchable objects are inherently un-sharable. That's the
        most fundamental issue here.
    + Note that private objects are also un-sharable, so they should be
        able to bypass some overhead in the future (see below)
    + Future effort will focus on making the "dispatchable" wrapper as
        efficient an abstraction as possible.
    + This basically makes a judgement call that everything should be
        sharable.

class AppObj:
    ''' A class for objects to be used by apps. Can be updated (if the 
    object was created by the connected Agent and is mutable) and have
    a state.
    
    AppObj instances will wrap their state in a dispatch structure 
    before updating golix containers.
    
    Can be initiated directly using a reference to an embed. May also be
    constructed from _EmbedBase.new_object.
    
    Everything here is wrapped from the messagepack dispatch format, so
    state may be more than just bytes.
    
    Unlike RawObj instances, AppObj instances are meant to be used with
    a specific API definition, and/or a specific token. Tokens can be 
    used to provide a consistent PRIVATE, freeform application state,
    whilst any objects that are being communicated to a different agent
    must use api ids.
    
    Basically, token-based AppObj instances without an api_id represent
    data that will not be shared. It can, however, be any unstructured
    data.
    
    _private isinstance bool
        if True, dispatch by token.
        if False, dispatch by api id.
        
    Note: AppObj should be set up such that there is exactly one AppObj
    per application. As such, they should probably be aware of their 
    endpoints.
    
    Note: Todo: Add some kind of automatic garbage collection mechanism
    such that, when gc'd because, for example, it is only defined within
    the scope of an AppObj state (as when linking between dynamic 
    objects), we don't continue to get updates for an object that we no
    longer retain.
