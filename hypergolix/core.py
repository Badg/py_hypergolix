Some notes:

There's an awkward balance between streams and dynamic bindings. Streams
are mutable plaintext objects and totally private, but only ever locally
updated by Agents (whether receiving or creating). However, dynamic 
bindings can be subscribed to at persistence providers, and are public 
objects there. So they need two objects; one for the dynamic binding, 
which is then resolved into GEOC objects, and one for its plaintext.


DO PERSISTENCE PROVIDERS FIRST.
