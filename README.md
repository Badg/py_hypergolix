# hypergolix

Hypergolix is a "full client" for the Golix protocol. That doesn't mean anything yet, so think of it as "docker for digital identities". If you're creating any internet-enabled application, Hypergolix is an alternative to rolling your own account management system. It is designed to give the person/program operating the client full, end-to-end cryptographic control over information sharing and retention.

It does not require application-level cryptographic code, and is available via IPC on the local machine (specifically through pipes, and potentially through localhost in the future).
